# Book Library App

## Overview

This is a simple book library app with basic CRUD operations initially built on local storage. To make it more challenging, a server was added, and the app now connects to an API implemented with NestJS.
  
- Front end is hosted on [Render](https://book-angular-t67b.onrender.com)
- Back end server is hosted on Render and is accsasable in env.ts on app dir 

**Note: No need to install the server file; the backend is already hosted.**

## Features

- View a list of books
- Add a new book
- Edit existing book details
- Delete a book from the library

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: Angular
- Backend: NestJS

## Usage

### Frontend (Render)



1. Visit the hosted application on [Live WebSite](https://book-angular-t67b.onrender.com).
2. Explore and interact with the book library.

### Backend (Cyclic)

**Warning:** The backend server is already hosted; there is no need to install the server file.

If you are interested in exploring or modifying the backend:

2. No need to install or run the server locally; it's already hosted for you.
